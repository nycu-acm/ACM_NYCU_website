## Physical / World model

We focuses on developing physical and world models that empower intelligent agents to understand, predict, and interact with their environment. By combining perception, dynamics, and reasoning, we aim to build systems that can simulate real-world scenarios, enabling robust decision-making and generalization in complex tasks.
