As noticed before, "Warm Diffusion: Recipe for Blur-Noise Mixture Diffusion Models", has been accepted at ICLR 2025. Our team attended the conference in Singapore to show our work and connect with researchers worldwide. We're grateful for the feedback and discussions, and we look forward to future collaborations!
